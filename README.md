 I generated captions to images using blip model and deployed the model on google cloud and I used streamlit for visualization <br>

 this is the link of the deployment on google I may close it because it cost money <br>
 https://image-captioning-service-ecdn2gcbaq-uc.a.run.app/Image_Captioning

 this is the deployment on streamlit but it has a problem with the caption model because it need memory more than streamlit offer <br>
